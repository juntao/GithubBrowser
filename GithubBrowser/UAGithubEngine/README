UAGithubEngine

=================

UAGithubEngine is a practically-complete wrapper around version 2 of the Github API (the exceptions being the network graph and Gist APIs, which are not currently implemented). Check out the API documentation (http://develop.github.com/) for full details of what the API can do. 

UAGithubEngine is compatible with Mac OS X 10.5 and above, and iOS 4.0.

How do I use it?
=================

* Copy across all the files in the 'Engine' group from the UAGithubEngine project into your app's project.

* Where you want to use the engine, follow the example from the included AppController class, making sure you #import "UAGithubEngine.h", and that your class adopts the UAGithubEngineDelegate protocol.

* Implement *at least* the following delegate methods:
   
    - (void)requestSucceeded:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)requestFailed:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier withError:(NSError *)error;

* Implement your choice of the remaining delegate methods, depending on your particular needs:

    - (void)connectionStarted:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)connectionFinished:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)usersReceived:(NSArray *)users forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)repositoriesReceived:(NSArray *)repositories forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)deployKeysReceived:(NSArray *)deployKeys forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)collaboratorsReceived:(NSArray *)collaborators forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)languagesReceived:(NSArray *)languages forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)tagsReceived:(NSArray *)tags forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)branchesReceived:(NSArray *)branches forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)commitsReceived:(NSArray *)commits forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)issuesReceived:(NSArray *)issues forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)labelsReceived:(NSArray *)labels forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)issueCommentsReceived:(NSArray *)issueComments forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)treeReceived:(NSArray *)treeContents forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)blobsReceieved:(NSArray *)blobs forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)blobReceived:(NSArray *)blob forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;
    - (void)rawBlobReceived:(NSData *)blob forConnection:(NSString *)connectionIdentifier;

* Instantiate an engine, passing a username and password, then call some methods. If you want to receive notifications when reachability status changes (UAGithubReachabilityStatusDidChangeNotification), pass YES as the final argument. For example:

	UAGithubEngine *engine = [[UAGithubEngine alloc] initWithUsername:@"aUser" password:@"aPassword" delegate:self withReachability:YES];
    [engine user:@"owainhunt"];

* Enjoy. The included AppController class will log the received data from any API calls the engine makes, so have a play around and see what happens - and happy app building!

UAGithubEngine is heavily based on the structure (and in some places the code) of Matt Gemmell's MGTwitterEngine.
UAGithubEngine uses a barely modified version of Jonathan Wight's TouchJSON parser.
